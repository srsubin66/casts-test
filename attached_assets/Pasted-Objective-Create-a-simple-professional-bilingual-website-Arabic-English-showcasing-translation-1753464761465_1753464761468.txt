5. Why Human Translation Still Matters (Dedicated Page)
Title: Why Human Translation Still Matters
Page Sections:
Intro

In a world where AI tools are becoming the norm, we believe that for many types of content, human translation still delivers the highest level of accuracy, nuance, and professionalism.

Our Policy

Core & Style does not use AI tools for translation unless explicitly instructed by the client. We rely on professional human linguists to ensure quality.

Where AI Falls Short

AI translation may work for simple, repetitive texts, but it struggles with:

Legal documents (risks with mistranslation, ambiguous terms)

Marketing & media content (tone, cultural references)

Complex sentence structure or nuance

Consistency in terminology across longer texts

Cultural sensitivity

Quality Comparison Example (Optional visual)

Side-by-side box comparing a human translation vs. a machine-generated version

Highlight tone, accuracy, and cultural fit differences

What If You Want AI Translation?

We can provide a hybrid option if speed is your priority, but this will be reflected in both delivery time and pricing.

Data Privacy Reminder

Your files are never uploaded to public platforms. Everything stays private and secure.
